## :book: About 

IN LIGHT Home Maintenance is your local South Aussie handyman business dedicated to fixing broken things in your home. For them, no job is too big or too small! 
This CRUD app project is a prototype to allow clients to sign up and log in to track job statuses and enquiries made with IN LIGHT Home Maintenance. 

:cake: FEATURES :cake:
- User specific feed (users can only see their own job statuses and enquiries and are restricted from seeing others)
- Admin control (admin can see ALL enquiries made by clients)

## :pencil2: Planning & problem Solving
When brainstorming ideas for the project, I thought of a relative's business requirement for an app that keeps track of client quotes and enquiries. Though at this stage it is not a fully functional app with the necessary business requirements, I thought of creating a prototype for it to begin with and further develop it onwards towards the near future.

In the initial stage I made a visual map/diagram for developing the app. However, I was not able to continue on as I was getting stuck and unable to move forward with approaching solving problems.
